Use your custom bangs with your search engine of choice.

It allows you to set the default search engine with the url itself.

Idea and some parts were taken from [Theo's unduck](https://github.com/t3dotgg/unduck) and adapted.

## Stack
- ~Bun~ (Bundling with tailwind does not work...)
- Vite
- Tailwind

## What does it do
- Allows you to set the default search engine with the url itself.
- Supports most of [DuckDuckGo bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bangs) and some custom ones (if you need one just open a pr).
- I own it so I get to add / change bangs to my liking.
- Heavy caching to keep loadtimes minimal.
- Using some HTML hacks to run redirects faster.
- (Hopefully) no flashbang when loading.
- Serving as a fun exercise.
