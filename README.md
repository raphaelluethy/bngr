Use your custom bangs with your search engine of choice.

It allows you to set the default search engine with the url itself.

Idea was shamelessly inspired by [Theo's unduck](https://github.com/t3dotgg/unduck)

What does it do:
- Allows you to set the default search engine with the url itself.
- Supports (DuckDuckGo bangs)[https://duckduckgo.com/bangs] and some custom ones (if you need one just open a pr).
- Heavy caching to keep loadtimes minimal.
- Using some HTML hacks to run redirects faster.
- (Hopefully) no flashbang when loading.
- Serving as a fun exercise.
